#show-hidden
===========

## Summary

I wrote a little script to automatically show/hide hidden folders and files on your Mac. It determines whether or not you have files and folders hidden (your "status") and then changes it to the opposite. So if files are hidden, then become shown and if they are shown, they become hidden.

I'm quite sure there are more sophisticated ways to do this, but this was just for fun.

## To execute

Point your terminal to the directory where the script exists and run `./showhidden.sh`.
